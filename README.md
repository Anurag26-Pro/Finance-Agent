# What are Agents?
Agents are autonomous programs that use language models to achieve tasks. They solve problems by running tools and using knowledge and memory to improve responses.
Instead of a rigid binary definition, let's think of Agents in terms of agency and autonomy.

- Level 0: Agents with no tools (basic inference tasks).
- Level 1: Agents with tools for autonomous task execution.
- Level 2: Agents with knowledge, combining memory and reasoning.
- Level 3: Teams of agents collaborating on complex workflows.
